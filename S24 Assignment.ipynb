    "## Assignment: **Library System with Enumerations and Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a **Library Management System** that uses **Enumerations** for book genres and membership levels. Additionally, custom exceptions must be implemented to handle error scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enumerations**\n",
    "   - `BookGenre` Enumeration:\n",
    "     - Genres: `FICTION`, `NON_FICTION`, `SCIENCE`, `HISTORY`, `BIOGRAPHY`\n",
    "     - Each genre must have an **automatic integer value** starting from 1.\n",
    "   - `MembershipLevel` Enumeration:\n",
    "     - Levels: `BASIC`, `PREMIUM`, `GOLD`\n",
    "     - Each membership level has a **custom annual fee**:\n",
    "       - BASIC: 100\n",
    "       - PREMIUM: 200\n",
    "       - GOLD: 500\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Custom Exceptions**\n",
    "   - `BookNotAvailableError`: Raised when a book is not available for borrowing.\n",
    "   - `InvalidMembershipError`: Raised when a non-existent membership level is referenced.\n",
    "   - `LateReturnError`: Raised when a book is returned after its due date.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classes**\n",
    "   - `Book`:\n",
    "     - Attributes: `title`, `genre` (from `BookGenre`), `is_available` (boolean).\n",
    "     - Methods:\n",
    "       - `borrow()`: Marks a book as unavailable. If already unavailable, raise `BookNotAvailableError`.\n",
    "       - `return_book(is_late: bool)`: Marks a book as available. If returned late (`is_late=True`), raise `LateReturnError`.\n",
    "   - `Member`:\n",
    "     - Attributes: `name`, `membership_level` (from `MembershipLevel`).\n",
    "     - Method:\n",
    "       - `get_fee()`: Returns the fee associated with the membership level. Raise `InvalidMembershipError` if the level is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Main Program Logic**\n",
    "   - Create multiple `Book` and `Member` objects.\n",
    "   - Test the borrowing, returning of books, and membership fee handling.\n",
    "   - Handle exceptions gracefully.\n",
